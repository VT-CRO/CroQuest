# Embedded Code

This will be the documentation for any code needed for the ESP32-S3


04/14/2025 (World Quantum Day): I am working on implementing a test game into the SD card, and adding a way that the game can be accessed from the menu. (Everything is in the "menu" directory).  


04/12/2025 Last updates, we have decided to change to "LovyanGFX" since it renders faster. 

https://github.com/lovyan03/LovyanGFX/tree/master

(I will transfer the previous code to the new library for testing purposes)


## Test file with new library is: screen_love.cpp. Use that one for reference.

# Menu

This will be the documentation for the menu that will be displayed on the screen when booting.


## Structure of menu

I have created the following structure that will be used for the menu layout. 

1) display_setup.hpp: Sets up the configuration for using the screen with the lovyanGFX
2) gfx_utils.hpp/cpp: You will find some functions that you can utilize for creating the menu.
3) main.cpp: Is where the main program that will run the menu layout. 

(screen_examples): I created some files to create some tests of how the menu would look, you can use it as a reference.
